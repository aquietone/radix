# radix
When you just really don't want to do tradeskills

## Overview

Created this script to help max out tradeskills for the Project Lazarus Radix quest. Its basically a UI around standard combine macros but with some extra information.  

Clone/download repo contents to `/path/to/macroquest/lua/radix` and then `/lua run radix`.  

Select a recipe under one of the tradeskill tabs and but the necessary materials, pick number of combines to perform and start crafting.  

There are still some bugs in this, not finished yet. At worst, use it as a guide to maxing out tradeskills.
